# UNFICYP - Team 3 - PeaceTech Collective
This repository contains code for our project (**UNFICYP Search**) for the Reboot UN-tapped initiative. Our team (**PeaceTech Collective**), which is tackling the UNFICYP challenge is made up of Christian, Daeun, Francis, Nela, Ricky, Simon and Stefan.

## UNFICYP Search
The United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) has a vast amount of data that has been created over a period of 60+ years. This data is stored in various siloed applications and databases and as such there is no unified way to search for information accross all this data.

Our solution seeks to fix this problem by ingesting all this data from the multiple systems and providing a unified AI powered search. A prototype of our solution is hosted [here](https://unficyp-search.vercel.app/)

**Key Features**
- Keyword/Lexical and Semantic Search
- Additional metadata creation during ingestion
- Saving of Historical Searches
- Chat with all the documents using an AI powered question and answer chatbot based on the ingested data
